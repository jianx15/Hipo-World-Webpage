        <h3 class="card_title">Hippos: The Surprisingly Agile Mammals</h3>
        <p class="card_text">Hippos, or hippopotamuses, are large semiaquatic mammals found in sub-Saharan Africa. They are known for their barrel-shaped bodies, short legs, and large mouths filled with sharp teeth. Despite their ungainly appearance, hippos are remarkably agile and fast both in water and on land. They can run at speeds of up to 19 miles per hour on land and are excellent swimmers.</p>

        <h3 class="card_title">Hippo Facts: Their Herbivorous Diet and Impressive Appetite</h3>
        <p class="card_text">Hippos are primarily herbivores and feed on a variety of vegetation, such as grasses and reeds. They have a large appetite and can consume up to 150 pounds of food in a single night. Despite their herbivorous diet, hippos are considered to be one of the most dangerous animals in Africa, responsible for more human deaths than any other large animal.</p>

        <h3 class="card_title">Hippos' Social Lives: Inside the World of Bloats and Pods</h3>
        <p class="card_text">In addition to their physical attributes and aggressive nature, hippos are also known for their unique social behaviors. They are social animals and live in groups called bloats or pods. These groups can consist of up to 100 individuals and are led by a dominant male. Female hippos give birth to a single calf every two of their young.
